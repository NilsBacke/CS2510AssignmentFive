\
AFish class:\
A abstract super class of UserFish and EnemyFish\
This class has fields: x, y, and size\
These fields are common to both UserFish and EnemyFish, and are therefore extracted out into an abstract class.\
\
UserFish class:\
A subclass of AFish\
This class represents the player fish object in the game\
This class has a moveUser method, which returns a new UserFish object at the appropriate coordinates\
This class also has a method that checks for when the UserFish is out of bounds, and has collided with a given enemy fish. It also has methods that grow the fish and produce the fish\'92s visual image.\
\
EnemyFish class:\
A subclass of AFish\
This class represents a background fish in the game\
This class has a direction, either -1 or 1, to determine which way it will move across the screen\
The fish\'92s y coordinate is randomly assigned, and it\'92s x coordinate is either 0 or 400\
This class has a method that will move the fish across the screen by 6 units, and a method that produces the fish\'92s visual image.\
\
ILoEnemyFish interface:\
This interface represents a list of EnemyFish\
This interface features multiple methods necessary to manipulate the background fish of the game\
\
MtLoEnemyFish class:\
This class implements the ILoEnemyFish interface and represents an empty list\
\
ConsLoEnemyFish class:\
This class implements the ILoEnemyFish interface and represents the list\
This class has an EnemyFish, first, and a ILoEnemyFish, rest.\
\
Fishy class:\
This class represents the world state of the game, as it extends the superclass World.\
